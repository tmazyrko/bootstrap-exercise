                        Encrypting your computer's disk(s) is a surefire way to add an extra, strong layer of protection
                        around your personal files. Anyone who obtains your device won't be able to read the data on
                        your encrypted drives, and most boot sector malware would also be rendered ineffective. If you
                        are using Windows, the best disk encryption solution is one called BitLocker, and it's already
                        built into the OS. BitLocker is a fairly mature encryption technology that works by encrypting
                        entire drives, but perhaps its most distinguishing feature is just how simple and seamlessly
                        integrated into Windows it is. Generally, using BitLocker comes at no cost; the performance
                        penalty that comes with full-disk disk encryption has been minimized by modern hardware like
                        SSDs. Plus, when encrypting you system drive, you generally won't even need to go through any
                        extra steps to unlock your computer&mdash;simply entering your Windows password will let
                        BitLocker unlock your drive.

                        For the MacOS users among us, Apple offers a similar integrated solution known as FileVault.
                        The encryption occurs on the fly, in the background as you use your Mac. Like BitLocker (unless
                        otherwise configured), FileVault uses AES-128 encryption in XTS mode with a 256-bit key, and
                        both tools are compliant with the US Government's Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
