                        Today, Google Search processes over 65,000 search queries per second&mdash;this is no surprise
                        seeing how Google is known for it's top-class search results and has become a household name.
                        However, using Google (and other common search engines like Yahoo or Bing) comes at a price:
                        your privacy. It only takes a quick glance through Google's
                        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">data privacy policies</a> to see that
                        they save things like your search queries and IP addresses to build a profile on each and every
                        one of their users. This profile is used to personalize your search results, sure, but it's
                        also used to target advertisements and is even sold to third-parties.

                        Fortunately, recent years have seen an increase in options for privacy-first search engines.
                        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is probably the most well known example with
                        about 60,000,000 daily searches. The company was founded in 2008, and uses a compilation of
                        over 400 sources to return search results all while not profiling any of its users. However,
                        my personal private search engine of choice is
                        <a href=https://www.startpage.com/"> Startpage</a>. They pay Google to use their search API,
                        effectively acting as a privacy buffer between you and Google's servers. In other words, you
                        still get Google's class-leading search results, just without the tracking. Additionally,
                        unlike DuckDuckGo which is headquartered in the US (a country notorious for it's abysmal
                        privacy laws), Startpage is headquartered in the Netherlands where privacy laws are among the
                        most stringent in the world.
