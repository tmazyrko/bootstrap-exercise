                        If you're looking to take your internet browsing privacy to the next level, Tor is the way. The
                        name is derived from its original project name, "The Onion Router", which in turn refers to the
                        onion routing method used by Tor. So how does it work? Long story short, onion routing has
                        layers (hence the name)&mdash;it uses other computers connected to the Tor network to create a chain
                        between your device and the server you are connecting to. None of the computers in the Tor network
                        know who is getting what, and all of the data is encrypted. In addition, the path of nodes taken
                        is changing constantly (every 10 minutes). All of this makes for a very, very anonymous system
                        where it is nearly impossible to trace any particular user, since the computer at one end of the
                        connection is not the one actually communicating to server at the other side.

                        This is great and all, but there is a catch. Browsing with Tor is slower than regular browsing,
                        since you have to connect to all of those middle-man computers in series. Still, Tor is easy to
                        set up and use, and is compared to other methods for anonymizing your web browsing.
