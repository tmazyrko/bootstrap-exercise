                        Windows 10 is a <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/operating-systems/#win10" target="_blank">privacy nightmare</a>.
                        According to <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/microsoft-windows10-privacy.html">this
                        article</a> (dated 2016), Windows sends your data to Microsoft's servers 5500 times
                        per day, even after disabling tracking and telemetry features. So, while it is something only
                        for the most dedicated, switching to a Linux operating system has a massive benefit in terms of
                        security and privacy, as you can regain control over your computer and have it function exactly
                        how you want it. Best of all, it's free!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are three Linux distributions to look into if you are thinking of making the switch:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Qubes OS</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank">Qubes</a>
                        is a free and open-source Linux-based operating system with a focus on providing security
                        and privacy for desktop computing. It uses xen-based virtualization to create and manage isolated
                        virtual machines (called qubes) which are purposed for containing isolated applications, managing
                        the network stack and firewall, and other user-defined tasks. Each VM is assigned its own level
                        of trust, and all windows are displayed on a unified desktop with colored window borders denoting
                        the security levels.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Fedora Workstation</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://getfedora.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a>
                        is a Linux distribution developed by the Fedora project and sponsored by Red Hat. It's a
                        secure and reliable operating system developed for desktops and laptops, and is much more
                        user-friendly than something like Qubes OS. The user interface (GNOME) is sleek, and is
                        especially suited for developers of any kind.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Debian</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian</a>
                        is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel, with its initial release being
                        in September 1993. It's a Unix-like operating system, and has been composed entirely of free and
                        open-source software since its founding. It's a great choice if you're looking for an OS that is
                        stable, reliable, has a huge community, and is backed by exactly zero corporations.
