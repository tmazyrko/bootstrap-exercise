                        To someone who doesn't know much about how computers function, the word "BIOS" may mean nothing
                        at all. Or, perhaps, it may strike fear into their hearts. While messing around with settings
                        in your computer's BIOS can be (rightfully) scary, it may be worth taking a short expedition into
                        in order to set a BIOS password.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While a password on your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.) prevents people from
                        logging into your user account, your computer's BIOS or UEFI firmware is capable of setting a
                        much lower-level password to protect your machine. Such a password restricts people from booting
                        the computer at all, tampering with BIOS/UEFI settings, and (most importantly) booting from
                        removable devices such as a USB. That last bit is vital because without a BIOS password, even
                        if you have a password on your Windows account, someone with physical access to your PC could
                        boot into a live Linux desktop from a USB drive and access any unencrypted data stored on your
                        hard drives. They could also insert a Windows installer disk and install a new copy of Windows
                        over the current one.

                        Of course, BIOS passwords are not perfect. If someone has physical access to your computer,
                        chances are they can easily break open your case and just steal your hard drives. Still,
                        it is an additional layer of security that is not difficult to set up, and there are also ways
                        to lock up a computer case. The process differs slightly between different motherboard models,
                        but you can follow a general guide such as

                        to set your own BIOS password.
