                        Despite what marketing may lead you to believe, VPNs are not a perfect one-stop solution to
                        online privacy. In fact, in most cases, VPNs do little to protect you unless paired with other
                        changes. A VPN <i>can</i> help you if you are connected to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, or
                        if you are worried about <b>only</b> your ISP collecting data about you. If that is the case,
                        you must keep in mind that when using a VPN you are still trusting the VPN provider with your
                        data. For that reason, using a free VPN is not all all recommended, and you must definitely do
                        some research into the provider you choose before signing up.

                        The experts over at <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/vpn/">privacytools.io</a>
                        have a few recommendations for VPN providers based on a very tough criteria. My favorite is
                        <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad VPN</a>, as they are fast, inexpensive ($5.50 per
                        month), and are independently audited by two cybersecurity firms. They are based in Sweden,
                        and have a unique way of creating an account which simply involves generating a random code on
                        the website. Simply write down the code, and use it to log in, pay for the service, and connect
                        devices from then on. This means no emails, usernames, passwords, etc. Total anonymity.
