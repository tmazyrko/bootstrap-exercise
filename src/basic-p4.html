                        A surprisingly common misconception about email is that it's private, or at least relatively
                        confidential. In reality, email is one of the least secure forms of communication one can use.
                        Emails are typically stored in multiple locations, including (but not limited to) the sender's
                        computer, the receiver's computer, and the ISP's servers. They can be intercepted anywhere and
                        read in transit, and if you are sending emails at work your company can legally monitor that
                        too. While setting up your own email server can be one of the more secure routes, you really
                        need to know what you're doing in order to keep things running smoothly. Fortunately, there
                        is another way.

                        <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> is an email service based in Geneva,
                        Switzerland that has a focus on privacy, encryption, and ease of use, and is the best option
                        for securing all of your emailing activities without going as far as hosting your own server.
                        It's been around since 2013, and thanks to the availability of a free account tier, it's very
                        easy to try with no commitments.

                        One of the biggest draws of ProtonMail is that the entire service is built on a zero-access
                        architecture. That is, all of your data is encrypted in such a way that it is inaccessible to
                        anyone but yourself. In addition, emails are transmitted in encrypted format between their
                        servers and your devices, and when you email someone else who also uses ProtonMail, the message
                        stays encrypted every step of the way. Even emails sent to non-ProtonMail users can be encrypted,
                        provided you share the decryption passphrase with the recipient. Overall, ProtonMail is
                        super easy to use, and since the company is incorporated in Switzerland, all of your data is
                        protected by the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act.
