                        Strong passwords are the mortar to the bricks of your online security&mdash;without them,
                        everything will fall apart and you will find your accounts hacked sooner or later. However,
                        as the complexity of a password increases, the convenience decreases. It becomes harder to
                        remember and many people resort to writing it down, which defeats the purpose of a strong
                        password entirely! Fortunately, you can use a password manager to make your password stronger,
                        and your life easier.

                        Think of a password manager like a notebook for storing all of your passwords, secured by a
                        master password than only you know. It may seem counter-intuitive to
                        entrust your various passwords to a single master password, but assuming you've chosen a strong
                        and unique, yet memorable, master password that you don't use anywhere else, then you are
                        setting yourself up for success.
                    </p>

                        Password managers can also generate and save strong, complex, and unique password when you sign
                        up for new accounts, ensuring that you are not reusing passwords or accidentally creating weak
                        ones on your own. There are plenty of options available online, but I personally use Bitwarden
                        due to its free and open-source nature. Check it out at
                        <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">bitwarden.com</a>.
